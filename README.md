# Notebooks for Machine Learning and AI
## Overview
This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks dedicated to exploring various topics in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It serves as a personal learning journal and a showcase of practical implementations of different algorithms, models, and concepts. The notebooks cover a range of subjects, from foundational ML algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures, providing clear, commented code examples and explanations.

## Features
Comprehensive Topics: The notebooks cover a wide array of topics, including:

- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

- Regression and Classification Models

- Neural Networks and Deep Learning

- Computer Vision (CNNs)

- Natural Language Processing (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs)

- Clear Explanations: Each notebook includes detailed markdown explanations of the theory, methodology, and results.

- Well-Commented Code: The code is meticulously commented to help with understanding the implementation.

- Data Visualization: Utilizes popular libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to visualize data and model performance.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to set up your environment to run the Jupyter Notebooks.

## Prerequisites
